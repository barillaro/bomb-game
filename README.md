# 💣 Bomb Game – Multiplayer Micro:bit Challenge
Welcome to the Bomb Game, a multiplayer interactive game developed by Sebastian Barillaro using BBC micro:bit v2 boards and programmed in JavaScript (MakeCode). This project was created as part of an educational activity for the Luxembourg Tech School (LTS) ASBL, designed to teach students about wireless communication, event-driven programming, and game logic in a fun and engaging way.

## 🎮 Game Concept
Players use micro:bit boards to send and receive "bomb" messages via radio. When a player receives a bomb, they must defuse it before it explodes! Each bomb message includes:

- A defuse code
- A countdown timer
- The ability to send bombs back in later stages
- The game evolves through multiple stages, gradually increasing in complexity and functionality.

## 🧩 Project Structure
The project is organized into five progressive branches, each representing a development milestone:

## Branch	Description
- T0	🧱 Initial Template – Skeleton code with function definitions and blanks for students to fill in.
- T1	🔧 Basic message reception and use of LED Matrix display.
- T2	⏱ Basic bomb reception and defuse logic implemented.
- T3	📡 Enhanced defusing codes options.
- T4	🔁 Ability to send bombs back to other players.
- T5	🎉 Final version with bonus features like sending bombs on demand.
